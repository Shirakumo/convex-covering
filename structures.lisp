;;; `hull'
;;;
;;; Internal data structure for representing convex hulls during the
;;; decomposition computation. In contrast to the `convex-hull' type
;;; which is part of the API, this structure type
;;;
;;; 1. Stores vertex data using a concrete (double-float)
;;;    representation where `convex-hull' mirrors the component type
;;;    supplied by the caller
;;;
;;; 2. Stores additional information such as normals and bounding boxes
